    <h3>About our Founder</h3>
    <p>Founded by Collin Cramer in 2020. Collin Cramer has always had a love for the game of golf. The idea for SOJO golf came from Collin visiting many golf courses, and they were either overpriced or missing some sort of feature that Collin deemed were necessary. It was decided that day that Collin Cramer would open the best Golfing center in all of Utah. Top Golf? Nah. Mulligans? Too old. This new course is the way of the future!</p>
