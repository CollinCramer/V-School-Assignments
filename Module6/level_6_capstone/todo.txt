Still needs to be done:
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

CSS (low priority)

Add ability to filter by media type on All Reviews

Only give someone access to add media if they are an admin

Dont let there be duplicate reviews for a single title. If someone is reviewing the same title, add the score to an array and put the average score on the all review card

use a library to get Icons for upvote and downvote

Clean up interface for comments. Make it small and clickable to expand. Also add username who left the comment. Like dislike too?

Add password requirements/ regex / validators in model
